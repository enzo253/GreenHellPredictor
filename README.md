## Green Hell Predictor

### Overview
The **Green Hell Predictor** is a powerful web application that predicts car performance and provides in-depth performance analysis based on various car specifications. Leveraging AI, the app can predict missing values in car data and estimate NÃ¼rburgring lap times with impressive accuracy.

### Features
- **AI-Powered Predictions:** Predict missing car performance values and estimate lap times using machine learning models.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore acceleration curves, 3D performance plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Dynamic UI:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit for seamless data exploration and insights.
